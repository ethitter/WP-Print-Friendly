Extends WordPress' template system to support printer-friendly templates. Works with permalink structures to support nice URLs.

== Description ==

Extends WordPress' template system to support printer-friendly templates for posts, pages, and custom post types. Uses WP standard template naming to support templates on a post-type basis. Supports printing paged posts on single page. Adds nice URLs for printer-friendly pages.

**IMPORTANT**: There are certain plugins that may interfere with this plugin's functionality. See the **FAQ** for more information.

== Installation ==

1. Upload wp-print-friendly.php to /wp-content/plugins/.
2. Activate plugin through the WordPress Plugins menu.
3. Navigate to Options > Permalinks and click *Save Changes* to update navigation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Print links don't work =
First, navigate to Options > Permalinks in WP Admin, click *Save Changes*, and try again.

If clicking on a print link takes you back to the post or page where the link appeared, see the **Known Plugin Conflicts** item below.

If, after reviewing the remaining FAQ, you are still experiencing problems, visit [http://www.thinkoomph.com/plugins-modules/wp-print-friendly/](http://www.thinkoomph.com/plugins-modules/wp-print-friendly/) and leave a comment detailing the problem.

= How should I name print templates? =
Print templates should be prefixed with *wpf* and follow WordPress template conventions from there. To use one template for all contexts unless otherwise specified, name your template *wpf.php.*

For both built-in and custom post types, *wpf-[post type name].php* will be used for that post type. To use a template for a single post type object, name your template *wpf-[post type name]-[slug].php*.

For custom taxonomies, follow the naming conventions for post types.

Similarly, *wpf-home.php* will load that template for the front page of your site.

The plugin also includes a default template that may suit many needs.

= How do I add a print link to my templates? =
The function `wpf_the_print_link` will add a link to the print-friendly version of whatever page it appears on. This function accepts the following arguments:

* **$page_link**: Set to true to add a link to the current page in a paged post in addition a to a link for the entire post.
* **$link_text**: Set to text that should appear for the print link. Defaults to *Print this post*.
* **$class**: Specifies the CSS class for the print link. Defaults to *print_link*.
* **$page_link_separator**: If $page_link is true, specifies what separator will appear between the print link for the entire post and the print link for the current page of the post.
* **$page_link_text**: If $page_link is true, specifies what text will appear for the print link for the current page. Defaults to *Print this page*.
* **$link_target**: If set to "new", print links will open in a new window.

= Known Plugin Conflicts =
This plugin is known to conflict with certain plugins, many pertaining to SEO and permalinks. Conflicting plugins include, but are not limited to, the following:

* **WordPress SEO by Yoast:** This plugin's `Permalink` options, particularly *Redirect attachment URL's to parent post URL* and *Redirect ugly URL's to clean permalinks. (Not recommended in many cases!)*, interfere with WP Print Friendly's ability to display print templates. Both must be disabled, and the site's rewrite rules regenerated (by visiting Options > Permalinks and clicking *Save Changes*), for WP Print Friendly to function.
